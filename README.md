## SECTION 1 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

With the advancement of A.I. techniques and capabilities, there have been big improvements and opportunities in the field of chatbots. These chatbots act as a conversational human replacement that users can interact with via speech or text. They can be deployed on websites, vending machines, service kiosks and, more commonly, on messaging platforms like Facebook messenger, Telegram, WeChat, Slack etc. 

The chatbot industry is set to grow to US$9.4 billion by 2024 from $2.6 billion in 2019. With such a high projection and useful capabilities which can be provided to users, it is vital for aspiring A.I. professionals to take up skills in this area as demands for natural language processing will only increase over time. The rise of A.I. Chatbot is growing more evident with big companies like Apple with Siri, Amazon with Alexa and Microsoft with Cortana being heavily marketed and pushed to consumers for adoption. Locally, companies like Singtel are using the “Ask Jaime” chatbot along with many other government institutes adopting the same type of technology for customer service enhancement.

Our focus for this project is providing a chatbot that can be helpful for users that struggle with a very common problem in their day to day lives. The problem we decided to tackle is “What should I eat today?”. This is a real life struggle everyone has everyday and we seek to help by giving more detailed ratings and information to help users make a better decision. We named our chatbot “Gastrotomi” and it will help give recommendations to users based on what they feel like eating or may have cravings for.
