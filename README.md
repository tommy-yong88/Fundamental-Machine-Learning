## SECTION 1 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

With advances in artificial intelligence over the last 20 years, researchers have been exploring the possibilities of how much computers can replicate human behavior or execute complex tasks that perhaps most humans are unable to do. With pattern recognition, it is possible to enable a computer to learn without specifically programming it to execute specific tasks. Examples of such tasks include, but are not limited to, self-driving vehicles, giving recommendations on videos(Netflix, youtube), fraud detection, predicting consumer trends and etc. 

Drawing inspiration from our previous project in our first semester at NUS ISS, our group has decided to go back to the home rental market and consider how landlords decide a price on renting out their homes. With over 6 million listings world wide and an annual revenue of $3 billion, which is expected to grow by 250% in 2020, we chose AirBnb as a case study and sourced the internet for datasets on AirBnb listings. The following project report will detail our approach to the project and state our findings. It is the team's aim to explore airbnb pricing trends by using different regression algorithms and reporting the findings.
